# nikuk1-regex-tutorial

## Description 

This idea was introduced to me by U of A's web development boot camp program.
I am expected to achieve the expected result.

"Create a tutorial that explains how a specific regular expression, or regex, functions by breaking down each part of the expression and describing what it does."
